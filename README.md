# 🚄 Renfe Timetables API 🚆

Welcome to the Renfe Timetables API project! This project aims to provide a super easy-to-use REST API for accessing Renfe Cercanías (commuter rail) timetables in Spain, making this valuable data more accessible for developers to build their own applications. 🇪🇸✨

Currently, the official data is provided in GTFS format, which, while comprehensive, isn't directly API-friendly. Another option is to use their official site, which is also not the best, or third party apps, which, even though they work cool and all, normally they dont provide an open API. This project bridges that gap!

## ⭐ Current Features

*   ✅ **Daily Data Fetching**: Automatically downloads the latest GTFS data for Renfe Cercanías daily via a GitHub Action.
*   💾 **SQLite Database**: Parses and stores the GTFS data into an SQLite database for efficient querying.
*   🚀 **API Endpoints**:
    *   `GET /`: Welcome message.
    *   `GET /stations`: Lists all stations. Supports fuzzy search with `?q={query}`.
    *   `GET /stations/{stationId}`: Retrieves details for a specific station by its ID.
    *   `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}`: Retrieves direct trip schedules. Defaults to today's date. Supports specific date querying with `?date={YYYY-MM-DD}`. Results are grouped to show unique departure/arrival time slots for the effective date.
    *   `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}/next`: Retrieves the very next available train for the route based on the current time in Spain.
*   🧪 **Unit & Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for API endpoints and logic.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Runtime & Toolkit**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler)
*   **Web Framework**: [HonoJS](https://hono.dev/) (Fast, lightweight, and works great with Bun!)
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Database**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (using `bun:sqlite`)
*   **Data Source**: Renfe's official GTFS feed.
*   **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (for daily data fetching and processing).
*   **Large File Storage**: [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (for handling large data files in the repository).

## 🚀 Getting Started & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mario-SO/project-polaris.git
    cd project-polaris
    ```

2.  **Install Git LFS:**
    Make sure you have Git LFS installed. Download it from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and run `git lfs install` once on your system.

3.  **Install Bun:**
    If you don't have Bun, install it from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/).

4.  **Fetch GTFS Data:**
    (This is normally done by the GitHub Action, but you can run it manually too)
    ```bash
    bun run ./scripts/get-timetables.ts
    ```

5.  **Install API Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd api
    bun install
    cd ..
    ```

6.  **Load Data into SQLite Database:**
    ```bash
    bun run ./api/src/load-data.ts
    ```
    This will create/update `data/gtfs.sqlite`.

7.  **Run the API Server:**
    ```bash
    bun run ./api/src/index.ts
    ```
    The API should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

8.  **Test the Endpoints:**
    Use `curl` or a tool like Postman. Examples:

    *   Get welcome message:
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/"
        ```
    *   List all stations:
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/stations"
        ```
    *   Search for stations (e.g., "madrid"):
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/stations?q=madrid"
        ```
    *   Get details for a specific station ID (replace `10000` with a valid ID):
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/stations/10000"
        ```
    *   Get timetable between Valdemoro and Sol (defaults to today):
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/Valdemoro/Sol"
        ```
    *   Get timetable for a specific date:
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/Valdemoro/Sol?date=2024-08-15"
        ```
    *   Get the next train from Valdemoro to Sol:
        ```bash
        curl "http://localhost:3000/Valdemoro/Sol/next"
        ```
    Replace station names and IDs with your desired values. Partial, case-insensitive matching is supported for station names in path parameters.

9.  **Run Tests:**
    To execute the test suite:
    ```bash
    bun test ./api/src/index.test.ts
    ```

## 📖 API Endpoints Detailed

Here's a breakdown of the available API endpoints:

### `GET /`
*   **Description**: Returns a simple welcome message from the API.
*   **Example**: `curl "http://localhost:3000/"`
*   **Response**: `Hello from Renfe Timetables API!`

### `GET /stations`
*   **Description**: Retrieves a list of all available train stations.
*   **Query Parameters**:
    *   `q` (optional): A string to filter station names. Performs a case-insensitive "LIKE" search (e.g., `q=Madrid` will find "Madrid-Principe Pio", "MADRID-CHAMARTIN-CLARA CAMPOAMOR", etc.). Returns a maximum of 50 results when `q` is used.
*   **Examples**:
    *   `curl "http://localhost:3000/stations"` (gets all stations)
    *   `curl "http://localhost:3000/stations?q=Atocha"` (searches for stations containing "Atocha")
*   **Response**: An array of station objects, each with `stop_id`, `stop_name`, `stop_lat`, `stop_lon`.

### `GET /stations/{stationId}`
*   **Description**: Fetches details for a specific station using its `stop_id`.
*   **Path Parameters**:
    *   `stationId`: The unique identifier of the station (e.g., `10000`).
*   **Example**: `curl "http://localhost:3000/stations/10000"`
*   **Response**: A station object with `stop_id`, `stop_name`, `stop_lat`, `stop_lon`, or a 404 error if not found.

### `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}`
*   **Description**: Provides a timetable of direct trips between a departure and arrival station. Station names in the path are matched case-insensitively and partially (the first good match is used).
*   **Path Parameters**:
    *   `departureStation`: Name (or partial name) of the departure station.
    *   `arrivalStation`: Name (or partial name) of the arrival station.
*   **Query Parameters**:
    *   `date` (optional): The specific date for the timetable in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. If not provided, defaults to the **current server date**.
*   **Examples**:
    *   `curl "http://localhost:3000/Valdemoro/Sol"` (timetable for today)
    *   `curl "http://localhost:3000/Chamartin/Atocha?date=2024-09-01"` (timetable for September 1st, 2024)
*   **Response**: A JSON object containing `departure_station_found`, `arrival_station_found`, `date_queried`, and a `timetable` array. Each item in the timetable includes `route_short_name`, `departure_station_departure_time`, `arrival_station_arrival_time`, etc. Returns a 404 if stations are not found or no services operate on the queried date. Results are grouped to show unique journey slots for the effective date.

### `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}/next`
*   **Description**: Returns the very next scheduled train for the specified route based on the **current time in Spain (Europe/Madrid timezone)**.
*   **Path Parameters**:
    *   `departureStation`: Name (or partial name) of the departure station.
    *   `arrivalStation`: Name (or partial name) of the arrival station.
*   **Example**: `curl "http://localhost:3000/Valdemoro/Sol/next"`
*   **Response**: A JSON object containing details of the `next_train` (if one is found for the remainder of the day in Spain), along with `departure_station_found`, `arrival_station_found`, `date_queried` (current date in Spain), and `time_queried` (current time in Spain when the request was processed). Returns a 404 if no further trains are found for the day.

## 💡 Important Notes on API Usage

*   **Station Name Matching**: For endpoints using station names in path parameters (`/{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}` and `.../next`), the API performs a case-insensitive, partial match against station names in the database. It will use the *first* station found that matches the provided term. For more precise control, use station IDs where possible or ensure your search terms are specific enough. The `/stations?q=` endpoint can help identify full names and IDs.
*   **Date Handling**:
    *   The `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}` endpoint defaults to the **current server's local date** if no `date` query parameter is supplied.
    *   When a `date` is provided (e.g., `?date=2024-08-20`), the API will query for that specific date.
    *   Invalid date formats for the `date` parameter will result in a 400 error.
*   **"Next Train" Timezone**: The `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}/next` endpoint specifically uses the **current time in Spain (Europe/Madrid)** to determine the "next" train. This ensures relevance for users in Spain, regardless of the server's physical location or local time.
*   **Character Encoding in Station Names**:
    *   When querying station names that include special characters (e.g., tildes like in "Chamartín", or other accented characters), these characters **must be URL-encoded** in the request path or query parameters.
    *   For example, to search for "Chamartín":
        *   **Incorrect (likely to fail or give wrong results):** `curl http://localhost:3000/Chamartín/Atocha`
        *   **Correct (URL-encoded `í` as `%C3%AD`):** `curl http://localhost:3000/Chamart%C3%ADn/Atocha`
    *   Similarly, if using the `/stations?q=` endpoint:
        *   **Incorrect:** `curl "http://localhost:3000/stations?q=Chamartín"`
        *   **Correct:** `curl "http://localhost:3000/stations?q=Chamart%C3%ADn"`
    *   Most HTTP clients and libraries will handle URL encoding automatically if you construct the URL correctly with the special characters. However, if you are manually crafting `curl` commands or building URLs, ensure proper encoding for reliable results. The API itself handles UTF-8 correctly on the backend, but the URL must be valid.

## 📝 TODO List & Next Steps

Here's a roadmap of planned enhancements and features:

### API Enhancements ⚙️

*   [x] **Date & Day Filtering**: ~~Implement proper filtering based on `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt` to show schedules for specific dates/days of the week (e.g., `GET /{dep}/{arr}?date=YYYY-MM-DD`).~~ (Implemented: Defaults to today, specific date via query param)
*   [ ] **Improved Station Matching**: 
    *   Handle ambiguous station names more gracefully (e.g., return multiple candidates for user selection instead of just the first match).
*   [ ] **Transfer Support**: Add logic to find journeys that require one or more transfers.
*   [ ] **Pagination**: Implement pagination for API responses (e.g., `?page=1&limit=20`).
*   [ ] **Advanced Querying**: Allow querying by arrival time, duration, etc.
*   [ ] **Input Validation**: Add more robust input validation for API parameters (some basic validation for date format exists).

### New API Endpoints 🗺️

*   [x] `GET /stations`: ~~List all available stations (perhaps with autocomplete support `?q=partial_name`).~~ (Implemented with `?q=` for search)
*   [x] `GET /stations/{station_id}`: ~~Get details for a specific station.~~ (Implemented)
*   [ ] `GET /stations/{station_name_or_id}/departures?date=YYYY-MM-DD&time=HH:MM`: Get all departures from a specific station.
*   [ ] `GET /routes`: List all available routes (e.g., C1, C2, C3).
*   [ ] `GET /routes/{route_id}`: Get details for a specific route, including its stops.
*   [ ] `GET /routes/{route_id}/schedule?date=YYYY-MM-DD`: Get the full schedule for a specific route on a given date.
*   [ ] `GET /trip/{trip_id}`: Get detailed information for a specific trip, including all its stop times.
*   [ ] `GET /{departureStation}/{arrivalStation}/next`: (This was implemented but not in the original TODO - adding as a reference)

### Deployment & Operations 🚢

*   [ ] **Automated API Deployment**: Set up CI/CD to deploy the Hono API (e.g., to Cloudflare Workers, Fly.io, Vercel, or a similar platform).
*   [ ] **Health Check Endpoint**: Add a `/health` endpoint for monitoring.
*   [ ] **Logging & Monitoring**: Implement more structured logging and monitoring for the API.

### Documentation & Development Experience 📚

*   [ ] **API Documentation**: Generate OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
*   [x] **Testing**: ~~Add unit and integration tests for the API logic and data loading scripts.~~ (Implemented for API endpoints)
*   [ ] **Refine CSV Parsing**: Make the CSV parser in `load-data.ts` more robust (e.g., handle escaped quotes/commas within fields if present in source data).
